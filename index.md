### Accomplishments
* Offensive Security Certified Professional OSCP (OS-19094)
* Finalists of Global Cyberlympics held at Washington DC - www.cyberlympics.org 
* Rewarded for uncovering critical vulnerability in asana.com (bug bounty)
* Rewarded for uncovering file inclusion vulnerability at cloudconvert.com as part of open source research
* Integrity check bypass vulnerability identified in pre-boot authentication software
* Identified many vulnerabilities in third party products deployed at major banking client
* My approach and understanding of tech world can be found here – https://techie-anand.blogspot.com  
* Tools/Script I created for the assessment of apps:
  * > Frida-Talkmore:  This python3 script is used to generate Frida (js) script for a specific functionality or code with in Android application. It consumes .smali fies as input and dumps out the frida JavaScript handler script. The handler can be used to instrument the android application to dump out all the arguments of different functions to output console. Much useful while assessing the crypto intensive apps or applications performing offline processing. (https://github.com/dr4gonw4ll/Frida-Talkmore)
  * > Fix-Client: Financial Information Exchange (FIX), A script to connect to FIX engine and send messages interactively. Existing FIX clients does not allow to send malicious payloads to FIX engine as the client performs type checking. This script uses SimpleFIX python library and has its own session management code written from scratch. (https://github.com/dr4gonw4ll/fix-client) 
  * > Burp-Extension – Tight integration of penetration test objectives. Useful for generation of pentest audit results. (https://github.com/dr4gonw4ll/BurpExtension)

### Skills
* Strong understanding of software and its underlying technology such as - x86 architecture, Windows/Linux Offensive Security, HTTP/HTTPs, LDAP, Directories, Native vs Managed code, Object oriented language, Web technologies, assembly language, regular expressions
* Web application vulnerability assessment and penetration testing
  * > Define vulnerability management strategy for an organization, Map organizations risk management objectives to community standards  
  * > Tested variety of applications ranging from third party (COTS) to custom application developed in house at major banking/financial client
  * > Applications based on different protocols such as http/https, SOAP, OFX, FIX and technologies such as Java (spring, struts) and .net
  * > Tools & vulnerabilities - BurpSuite, Owasp ZAP, CORS, SOP, Web Services (REST, SOAP), Burp Extension Development, Automated scanning tools, JavaScript vulnerabilities,
 Oauth2, JWT, CSRF, OWASP, XSS, Missing Origin Validations and prototype pollution in JavaScript, CRLF injection, Sqli, Deserialization, JSON, XXE, SSL/TLS, Write custom scripts
 using python3
* Mobile application vulnerability assessment and penetration testing (iOS & Android):
  * > Performed pentest of mobile applications based on Android/iOS platform. Application based on Cordova, blackberry access, Xamarin (.net)
  * > Mobile apps supporting MFA (FIDO), Time based OTP (TOTP), biometric authentication and crypto intensive apps were tested at financial organization
  * > Root/jailbreak and ssl pinning bypass through instrumentation and manipulation of function return values, and identification of default sdk/libs classes to bypass the implementations 
  * > Tools used- Java, ADB, ARM, apktool, dex2jar, instrumentation, frida, objection, nodejs, sqlite, root bypass, jailbreak bypass, passionfruit,  Cutter dissembler, plist viewer, Jailbreak, fridump, xcode, location spoofing, reverse engineering  
* Network penetration testing
  * > Scan the network infrastructure with nmap and its supported scripts, Use Nessus scanner to perform the network scan. Write Bash scripts to automate the process or leverage python asynchronous modules to perform tasks where needed
  * > Performed both blackbox and whitebox pentest (local privilege escalations and build review) of critical infrastructure such as directory server and kerberos
  * > Identify the services running of system, check for the code of available services (if any) and perform deeper assessment
